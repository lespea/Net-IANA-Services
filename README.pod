=head1 DESCRIPTION

Working with named services can be a pain when you want to go back and forth between the port and
its real name.  This module helps alleviate some of those pain points by defining some helping
hashes, functions, and regular expressions.

=head1 CONSTANTS

=head2 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS

Regular expression to match any port, irregardless of which protocol it goes over.

While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the hashes or subroutines instead
as they are much better.  This is merely for your convenience.

Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

=head3 Example

    # Matches
    $port =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS;

    # Won't match
    $non_port =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS;

=head2 $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES

Regular expression to match any service, irregardless of which protocol it goes over.

While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the hashes or subroutines instead
as they are much better.  This is merely for your convenience.

Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

=head3 Example

    # Matches
    $service =~ $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES;

    # Won't match
    $non_service =~ $IANA_REGEX_SERVICES;

=head2 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_DCCP

Regular expression to match any port that is known to work over dccp.

While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the hashes or subroutines instead
as they are much better.  This is merely for your convenience.

Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

=head3 Example

    # Matches
    $port_dccp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_DCCP;

    # Won't match
    $non_port_dccp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_DCCP;

=head2 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_SCTP

Regular expression to match any port that is known to work over sctp.

While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the hashes or subroutines instead

    $non_port_tcp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_TCP;

=head2 $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_UDP

Regular expression to match any port that is known to work over udp.

While this is a highly optimized regex, you should consider using the hashes or subroutines instead
as they are much better.  This is merely for your convenience.

Case is ignored and the protocol must match on a word boundary!

=head3 Example

    # Matches
    $port_udp =~ $IANA_REGEX_PORTS_UDP;

    #       },
    #   },

=head2 $IANA_HASH_SERVICES_FOR_PORT

This lists all of the services for the given port, irregardless of the protocol.

An empty list will be returned if nothing is found.  This respects wantarray>

    Dumper $port_22;
    # [qw/ ssh /];
