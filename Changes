    [Bugs]
        *   Generate files with normal YAML instead of YAML::XS since it generates files that are
            causing problems on cpantesters

    [Enhancement]
        *   Recommend YAML::XS since loading the module is extremely slow with normal YAML!

    [Bugs]
        *   Sub examples now correctly indicate undef instead of empty refs
        *   Don't use Dumper since it creates regexes that are only compatable with perls > 5.14
        *   Change service regex so they work without additional anchors

        *   Test the examples
        *   Don't generate the massive port pod -- not very useful

    [Bugs]

        *   Fix bad examples
        *   Subroutines respect wantarray
        *   'Has' subroutines actually use the optional protocol if it's given
        *   Port regex makes sure the leading char isn't a negative symbol
